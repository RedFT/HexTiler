# HexTiler

A Hexagon Tiling Application

### Prerequisites

You need to have `python2.7`, `pygame`, and `numpy` installed.


## Using HexTiler

- load tilesets with `i`.
- load tilemaps with `l`.
- save tilemaps with `s`.
- `<` to shift selected tile left.
- `>` to shift selected tile right.
- `left click` to set a tile.
- `right click` to remove a tile.
- `middle click` and `drag` to move camera around.
- `up arrow`, `down arrow`, `left arrow`, `right arrow` will also move the camera.

I've included a sample tileset in `assets/` called `hexes.png`. To load it, 
press `i`, navigate and open to `assets/hexes.png`. Click around on the screen
to start placing tiles.

I've also included some sample maps in `assets/` as well. To load them, press
`l`, navigate to `assets/` and load any of the files with the extension `.json`.
